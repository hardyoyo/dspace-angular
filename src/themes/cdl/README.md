# CDL Theme for DSpace 7

A custom theme for CDL, for use with DSpace 7.x, created following the
[User Interface Customization documentation for DSpace 7.x](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/User+Interface+Customization)

## History
This theme is based on the
[dspace](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/tree/main/src/themes/dspace) 
theme for DSpace-Angular. It was originally created to work with DSpace 7.1. It 
was re-created, based on the dspace theme, during our upgrade from DSpace 7.1 to 
7.2. The theme was ported from version 7.2 to 7.3, following the [instructions 
on the DSpace wiki](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Upgrading+DSpace).
